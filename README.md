# SatelliteChangeNet: Deep learning approach for Detection and Prediction

## Overview

This project evaluates the performance of three prominent image processing algorithms: U-Net, R-CNN, and YOLO, applied to land cover and land use classification in remote sensing images. The findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each algorithm and provide specific recommendations based on their performance.

## Key Findings

- **U-Net**: Achieved 85% accuracy in fine-grained segmentation tasks. Ideal for applications requiring detailed and precise segmentation.
- **R-CNN**: Achieved 83% accuracy in precise localization tasks. Suitable for tasks that require identifying the exact location of objects.
- **YOLO**: Achieved 88% accuracy for real-time large-scale monitoring. Best for applications needing real-time detection and efficiency.

## Conclusion

Each algorithm has its strengths tailored to specific tasks:
- **U-Net**: Recommended for detailed segmentation tasks.
- **R-CNN**: Ideal for precise object localization.
- **YOLO**: Best for real-time detection and large-scale monitoring.

Understanding these strengths and limitations helps in selecting the appropriate model for various image processing tasks.
